.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
.IR fixwinsz (1)
is an LD_PRELOAD wrapper which hooks
.IR ioctl (2)
calls.  If a given ioctl is
.BR TIOCGWINSZ ,
which is the method that Linux programs use to get the size of the parent
terminal in columns and rows,
.IR fixwinsz (1)
will limit the returned area size to \fIWIDTH\fRx\fIHEIGHT\fR.

.SH BUGS
.IX Header "BUGS"
.IP \[bu] 2
Some interactive curses programs like
.IR vim (1)
will leave lasting effects if launched under
.IR fixwinsz (1).
The utility does not currently solve this problem (see RATIONALE);
run any fullscreen curses application again to fix this.

.SH RATIONALE
.IX Header "RATIONALE"
.IR fixwinsz (1)
was created to non-invasively force
.IR wget (1)'s
progress bar to stay limited to a reasonable size, thus avoiding the problem
of garbage symbols all over the place any time the terminal would get resized.
It is unlikely that this software will ever become sophisticated enough
for more complex terminal-related problems.
